# Sushi Plate Calculator

A largely over-engineered app to calculate Sushi Plate prices at a popular UK sushi restaurant.
This app was made in Oct/Nov 2017 to make a simple app that would include a large number of common libraries, have extensive Unit and UI testing and to experiment.

The app is available on the google play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplyapp.plate.calculator&hl=en)
